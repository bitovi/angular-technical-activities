# Technical Activity Purpose

This repository is designed to evaluate component Architecture and how well
candidates structure reusable components.

The core skill sets to showcase:

1. Maintaining **backwards compatibility**.
2. Providing a good developer experience and "escape hatches" to **keep development unblocked**.
3. Accessibility and Angular best practices.

# The Activities

Finding a solution is more important that providing the "most correct" solution.

Once a solution is found, please provide considerations for improvements
verbally.

> Although you can use whatever API you want for your solutions, it is suggested to stay away from the Signals API as the expected solutions are harder to implement using them.

# Important Directories:

All activities are found in `src/app/activities`. Follow the prompts and solve the
technical tasks as provided verbally.

1. `src/app/activities` - Contains all activities
2. `src/styles/_variables.scss` - Style tokens for theming for all components

All the other files are not relevant to the activities and should not be updated.

Within each activity, are important directories to know of:

```
/select-activity
  ∟ components // contains component implementation
  ∟ ui // contains playground to showcase component states
  ∟ demo // client developer's consumption of component on a live page
```
